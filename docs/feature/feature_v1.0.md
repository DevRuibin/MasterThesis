:dancer:==At the start, the lock generates an encrypted token and forwards it to the server through LoRnWAN. The server can then allocate it to a paid user who can use the token to unlock the lock. After the token is utilized, the lock generates a new one while the old one becomes invalid. The user must ensure that the property is placed in a specified location, otherwise, the lock won't work. The cost of usage will be calculated based on the duration of usage.==:dancer:
